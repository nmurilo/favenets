# FaveNets 
prefnet is a small program to catch devices searching for "favorite/preferred" wifi networks 

NOTICE: The interface MUST be in MONITOR state. 
        Use -i flag to change the interface if you need it. 


Chop is a bash script for channel hopping according to the frequencies supported by the wifi interface. 
It is useful to capture preferred network requests in all channels available. 
Run it in parallel with 'prefnet' on other terminal window.
